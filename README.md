Model-Selection Classification


In machine learning, Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning. Classification is the problem
of identifying to which of a set of categories, a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set
of data containing observations whose category membership is known. Classification is one of the most
widely used techniques in machine learning, for medical diagnosis and image classification etc. Linear
classifiers are among the most practical classification methods. In this project, we have provided with 4
different Train datasets (Psoriasis, Lupus, Autism, Psoriasis RNAseq) and one dataset for each case in
order to predict the labels of their samples. All data downloaded from https://inclass.kaggle.com/.
